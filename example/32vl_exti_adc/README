This configures quite a few things.

* ADC input on PA5.  When this is > 0x700 (half way) a user LED on PA4 turns on.
* user button one (on the 32VL discovery board) is an external interrupt, which
  changes the blink rate of the onboard LEDs

In addition, this shows the use of overriding  SystemInit() to set up clocks
differently.  (The STM32VL starts up in 8Mhz HSI mode, not 16MHz HSE mode) (TBC)
